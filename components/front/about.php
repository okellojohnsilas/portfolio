                     </div>
                     <p class="text-justify">I am a self-motivated and personable software developer with a proven ability to translate
                         complex business needs into streamlined and innovative technical solutions. Recognized as a
                         team player, I excel in collaborative environments, working seamlessly with team members to
                         implement and manage existing business platforms. My adaptability shines through when
                         collaborating with data and operations teams to ensure the fulfillment of customer needs.
                         In addition to my core competencies, I possess specialized skills in Machine Learning and Deep
                         Learning, particularly in the realm of cancer research and radiomics. My expertise extends to
                         tackling technical issues, creating and maintaining comprehensive system documentation,
                         conducting quality assurance and testing, and delivering technical training to teams and
                         partners.
                         Backed by a solid academic and technical foundation, I bring efficiency to the creation of
                         unique solutions for both clients and proprietary applications. I am adept at participating in
                         the development of project infrastructure and defining application aesthetics and functionality
                         based on user interactions. My holistic approach ensures that not only are technical
                         requirements met, but user experiences are also optimized.
                         My commitment to staying at the forefront of technological advancements, particularly in the
                         field of Machine Learning, underscores my dedication to delivering cutting-edge solutions,
                         especially in the critical domain of cancer research and radiomics.</p>
